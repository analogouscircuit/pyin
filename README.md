# pyin
Simple Python/NumPy implementation of de Cheveigné and Kawahara's YIN pitch detection algorithm. 
There is another [Python implementation](https://github.com/rciurlea/yin-python) 
on Github, but this one is much faster since it uses NumPy. The same audio sample 
used there is copied here for testing.
